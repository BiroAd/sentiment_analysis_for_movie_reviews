# Sentiment analysis for movie reviews

This repo hosts my homework project for the course [Training Project Laboratory](https://smartlab.tmit.bme.hu/oktatas-temalabor) at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The project is a solution for the [Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews) Kaggle competition.

During my homework, I compared multiple architectural solutions, including some where I utilized an existing word embedding.

## Result

The IPython notebook clearly shows model accuracies ranging between 65-69%. As expected, the fine-tuned DistilBERT model performed the best, reaching approximately 69% accuracy. The other models exhibited similar performance levels.
